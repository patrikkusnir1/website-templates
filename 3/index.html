              We’ll continue to fight for our values, and I believe that any CEO of this incredible company, regardless
              of
              race,
              gender, or sexual orientation, would do the same. And I will personally continue to advocate for equality
              for all people
              until my toes point up.

              that writing this puts me in their league. All it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that
              I’m doing my

            So what’s an American consumer to do in the meantime? For help answering that, I turned to Dave Hanson.
            Mr.
            Hanson, a
            Spokane, Wash., resident, is one of the savviest card users I know. He also happens to have studied
            philosophy in
            graduate school at the University of Chicago and taught applied ethics at Gonzaga University.

            He’s not cutting up his cards just yet. “The marginal effect of my individual use of plastic simply won’t
            impact the
            larger outcome,” he said. “The assumption that we ought to act in a way that we wish all of us would act
            ignores the
            fact that there is no mechanism by which we can ensure that we will all act that way. And we won’t.”

            The only practical solution would be for Congress to mandate lower transaction fees. I fail to see how
            this
            either
            should or could be Apple’s problem to solve.
